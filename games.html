  <h1>What is this page for?</h1>
  <p>
    This page is for games, and game related projects I might be working on, I guess.

  <p>
    This game is a basic circle game. You need to pick the correct order of the circles.
    Enter the number of circles you would like below. The circles will turn green if you selected correctly.
    Now, you may be thinking, "this isn't a game, this just sounds like guessing."
    If that is what you are thinking, you would be correct. Oh, right, one more twist, this is randomized,
    so if you guess wrong, it will be a new order. Good luck!
